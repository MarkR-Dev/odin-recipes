# odin-recipes
Recipes project to practice beginner HTML.

Topics covered:
- Text
- Lists
- Links (relative path)
- Images
- File management
- Git commands (status, add, commit, log, push)

Things to improve on:
- Keep a more consistent naming convention between images and their respective html pages
- Keep a more consistent git commit message description across the whole project
