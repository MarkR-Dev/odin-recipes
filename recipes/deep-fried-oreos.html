        <h3>Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried â€” yummy!</h3>

        <p>It couldn't be simpler to make deep-fried Oreos at home: Make the batter, dip the cookies in the batter, and fry the cookies in batches until they're golden brown. Dust the finished Oreos with powdered sugar for a perfect presentation.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
        </ol>
