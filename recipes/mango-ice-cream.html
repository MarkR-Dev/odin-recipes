            <li>1 1/2 cupsmango puree (from 4 to 5 mangos)</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and dice mangoes. Place in a blender and blend until pureed; measure out 1 1/2 cups puree; set aside. Refrigerate remaining puree for another use.</li>
            <li>Whip heavy cream and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Reduce the mixer speed to low and mix in mango puree.</li>
